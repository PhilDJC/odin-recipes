    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <h3>For the Ribs:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 racks of pork baby back ribs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons smoked paprika</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to your level of darkness)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the BBQ Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1/2 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup molasses</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <h3>Prepare the Ribs:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by removing the membrane from the back of the ribs. Use a knife to gently lift it from one corner and then pull it off. This step is crucial for tender ribs.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix the brown sugar, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. This will be your rub.</li>
        <li>Rub the spice mixture all over the ribs, ensuring they are well-coated with the dark and sinister flavors.</li>
        <li>Place the ribs in a large, heavy-duty aluminum foil packet. Pour the apple cider vinegar and water into the packet. Seal it tightly and let the ribs marinate in this dark bath for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator. Longer if you dare.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Prepare the BBQ Sauce:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a cauldron... I mean, a saucepan, combine the ketchup, apple cider vinegar, molasses, brown sugar, smoked paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Let it simmer for 10-15 minutes until it thickens and darkens to your liking.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>The Dark Ritual:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. When it's ready, remove the ribs from the foil packet and place them directly on the grill.</li>
        <li>Grill the ribs, turning and basting them with the dark BBQ sauce, until they are dark and sinisterly tender. This will take about 15-20 minutes, but watch them closely.</li>
        <li>Once they are darkened to perfection, remove the ribs from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Serve with Dark Delight:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the ribs into individual pieces, and serve them on a platter.</li>
        <li>Drizzle some extra BBQ sauce over the top for that extra dark and sinister flavor.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Prepare to feast, but remember, these Dark and Sinister BBQ Ribs come with a price. Enjoy, if you dare!</p>
